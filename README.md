# Markdown LearningCards
 A tool to create Anki-LearningCards from Markdown-Files.
 
 ### What is the current status?
 The program can create simple anki-flashcards from a single Markdown file.
 Other than that the code can generate a simple html site from the flashcards.

 ### What is the next goal?
 Adding a function that scans a certain directory and reads the Files that should be converted to Anki.
 Also there should be some system to determine if the file is supposed to be converted to anki or not.

 ### What is the motivation behind this project?
 I'm a computer science student who wants to use this tool to create flashcards in anki through their notes from Obsidian without the extra effort of typing out every flashcard. 
 Instead the cards should be created through this tool.

### Usage
